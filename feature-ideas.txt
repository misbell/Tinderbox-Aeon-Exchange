arcs notes updating
entities notes updating

list relationships and tags in note file

list date in text
list relationships in text every time

a note to reduce to the last text entry across all notes

give revisions a number as well as a dt (later)

add separators and columns during merge

update tbx start date IMPORTANT

add badge attribute to prototypes so easily changeable

no

they just have to know how to do that

but have to get arcs and entities straight

and time to think about tags and the fun i could have with them

just add relationships as attributes and tags as attributes
whoa that makes sense

yeah. that's it'


idea: import only a specified arc, or a specified entity.

now we're talking. yes.

also,use aeon's tags to slice and dice imports. now that will be a very powerful tool.

see, that let's you go into one head mode, where you're just grinding away organizing the events on the arcs and calendar. and then you can use TASC to act as a query tool for slicing and dicing the data.


1 arcs backup containers
2 arcs tags
3 arcs just match  on name

thinking about the search tool
read all tbx docs in the directory
find all notes that match some criteria
write them to a new doc
so your query returns a new tinderbox doc as a result



=============

for an arc, compile all the text into one note

============

for a relationship compileal all text into one note

==============

general idea
compile your notes according to a structure

==============
turn off green badges on straight add


============


count elements in tasc container is coiunting everything inc adornments and prototypes
just count real elements

for each test, just count thoes, for example, events

=================
so, i'm not crazy about scrivener until much later, at least 3/5 of the way through the writing process. and its index cards are a joke compared to what tinderbox can do for you.

what i'd really like to do is compose my notes in tinderbox, using scene and narrative structures i've created and then compile them into text documents.

so that's exactly what i'm going to do. i'll write an app that traverses tinderbox notes according to structures, pulls out the text, makes a doc.

oh, this is going to be fun. and i already wrote most of the code, that's the beautiful thing about writing xml transform code. once you've got it working you can cut and paste the loops.
